## Introduction

If you have a simple website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or generated output from a static site generator), you can host it completely **for free** using GitHub Pages. No server management, no backend, no hosting bills. In this article, you’ll learn how to get your static site online using GitHub Pages, configure a custom domain, optimize for SEO, and maintain your site efficiently.

## What Is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service offered by GitHub. It takes the static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from a repository and publishes them as a website. It supports optional build steps (such as using Jekyll) and enables global delivery via HTTPS.

There are two main types of GitHub Pages sites:

- **User / organization site** — your repository must be named `username.github.io`, and the site is published at `https://username.github.io`.  
- **Project site** — any repository can publish a site under `https://username.github.io/repository-name`.  

GitHub Pages is available for public repositories on GitHub Free, and supports HTTPS, custom domains, and automatic build/deployment from branches.

## Why Choose GitHub Pages?

- It’s **free** for static content.  
- Easy versioning and deployment via Git.  
- Built-in support for Jekyll (Markdown + templating).  
- You can push updates and have them go live automatically.  
- Ability to use your own domain with HTTPS.  
- Great choice for portfolios, documentation, blogs (static), project sites, and marketing pages.

However, note that GitHub Pages only supports static content — you cannot run server-side code (e.g. PHP, Node, Python backend) or databases natively.

## Step-by-Step: Publishing Your Static Website

### 1. Create (or use) a GitHub account

If you don’t already have one, sign up on GitHub and verify your email.

### 2. Create a repository for your site

- For a **user/organization site**, name the repo exactly `username.github.io` (replace `username` with your GitHub username).  
- For a **project site**, choose any repository name.  
- Make the repository **public** (free GitHub Pages requires public repos for publishing).  
- Optionally initialize with a `README.md`.

### 3. Add your website files

You need at minimum an `index.html` (or `index.md`) file in the root (or publishing folder). You can use:

- **Web interface**: upload your HTML, CSS, JS, images via GitHub’s “Add file → Upload files”.  
- **Local Git**: clone the repository, add your site files, commit, and push.

Ensure your internal links are relative, and your assets (CSS, JS, images) are correctly referenced.

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages in settings

- Go to your repository’s **Settings → Pages** (or “Code and automation → Pages”).  
- Under “Build and deployment”, select a **branch** (commonly `main` or `master`) and choose the folder (`/` root or a subfolder like `/docs`).  
- Save that configuration.  
- Wait a few minutes for GitHub to build and publish your site.  
- Your site will be available at `https://username.github.io` or `https://username.github.io/repo-name`.

### 5. Use a custom domain (optional)

To use your own domain (e.g. `www.example.com`), do the following:

1. In your repository’s Pages settings, add the custom domain (e.g. `www.example.com`). GitHub will expect a file `CNAME` containing that domain in the publishing branch.  
2. In your DNS settings:
   - For a subdomain (`www`), point a **CNAME** record to `username.github.io`.  
   - For a root/apex domain, add **A** records pointing to GitHub Pages’ IP addresses (e.g. `185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153`, `185.199.111.153`).  
3. Wait for DNS propagation (can take minutes to hours).  
4. In GitHub settings, enable “Enforce HTTPS” (if available) for your custom domain.

### 6. Update and maintain your site

Whenever you want to change content:

- Edit files locally or via GitHub interface.  
- Commit and push changes to the publishing branch.  
- GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and republish your site (usually within a few minutes).  

If you are using a static site generator (like Jekyll, Hugo, etc.), you may build locally and push the generated output, or use a GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy.

### 7. Disable Jekyll (if needed)

If you don’t want GitHub to process your site with Jekyll (for example, if you're using another build tool), you can add an empty file named `.nojekyll` in the root of your publishing branch to disable Jekyll processing.

## SEO & Best Practice Tips

- Give each page a **unique title** and **meta description**.  
- Use proper header tags (H1, H2, H3) semantically.  
- Ensure your site is **mobile-responsive**.  
- Use **alt** text on images for accessibility and SEO.  
- Generate and publish
