## Introduction

If you’re looking to build a blog that’s fast, lightweight, and easy to maintain, Eleventy (also known as 11ty) is an excellent choice. It lets you write content in Markdown, combine that with flexible templates, and generate a static site you can deploy anywhere. In this article, I’ll walk you through the essential steps, best practices, and tips to build your Eleventy blog in a way that’s optimized for performance and SEO.

## What Is Eleventy and Why Use It?

Eleventy is a static site generator built in JavaScript. It transforms content and templates into static HTML files at build time, rather than generating pages dynamically on each request. This leads to faster page loads, simpler hosting, and lower maintenance.

Key advantages of Eleventy include:

- Support for many template languages (Markdown, Nunjucks, Liquid, etc.)
- Minimal required configuration — it works out of the box
- Flexibility to structure your project as you like
- Good support for SEO (metadata, sitemap, clean URLs)
- Easy deployment on static hosts or CDNs

Because pages are pre-rendered, there’s no backend database or server logic involved, which reduces complexity and improves security.

## Project Structure & Setup

Here’s a typical folder layout for an Eleventy blog:

```bash
my-blog/
├── src/
│   ├── posts/
│   │   ├── first-post.md
│   │   └── another-post.md
│   ├── about.md
│   └── index.md
├── _includes/
│   └── layouts/
│       └── base.njk
├── .eleventy.js
└── package.json
```
- src/ holds your content (Markdown files).
- posts/ can hold your blog posts.
- _includes/layouts/ holds shared layout templates (e.g. base or post layout).
- .eleventy.js is your configuration file.
- package.json to manage dependencies and scripts.

A minimal .eleventy.js might look like:

```js
module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
  return {
    dir: {
      input: "src",
      includes: "_includes",
      output: "dist"
    },
    markdownTemplateEngine: "njk"
  }
}
```

In your layout template (e.g. base.njk), you’d include standard HTML head tags, metadata, and placeholders for content and SEO meta tags.

## Writing Blog Posts with SEO in Mind

Use front matter in your Markdown files to define metadata. Example:

```md
---
title: "My First Blog Post"
date: 2025-09-26
tags:
  - eleventy
  - static site
description: "An introduction to building a blog using Eleventy."
layout: layouts/base.njk
---

# My First Blog Post

This is where your post content goes.

```

Some tips for SEO:

- Always include a concise description (meta description).
- Use meaningful, keyword-rich post titles.
- Use headings (##, ###) properly to structure content.
- Add alt attributes to images.
- Use internal linking (link between posts).
- Generate a sitemap and use robots.txt to guide search engines.

Eleventy has plugins (or you can write your own filters) to generate a sitemap.xml and RSS feed.

## Listing and Pagination

To show a list of blog posts, you can create an index page (e.g. src/index.md) or a custom template that loops through all posts. Eleventy supports collections, which lets you group content — for example, a collection("posts") that contains all your posts sorted by date.

To implement pagination (e.g. showing 10 posts per page), Eleventy supports built-in pagination features so you can automatically split long lists into pages.

---

## Enhancements & Plugins

To improve your blog further, consider:

- **Syntax highlighting** for code blocks
- **Image optimization** (automatically resizing, converting to WebP/AVIF)
- **Compressed CSS & JS**
- **Schema.org / JSON-LD** metadata for rich results
- **Open Graph / Twitter Cards** metadata for social sharing
- **RSS / Atom feeds**
- **Search** (via client-side search or integrating with services)

Many of these can be achieved with Eleventy plugins or custom scripts in your build process.

---

## Deployment Strategies

Because the result is static HTML, you can deploy your blog on:

- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Any static file hosting or CDN

You typically set up a build pipeline (e.g. GitHub Actions, Netlify build, or Vercel) that runs eleventy (or npx @11ty/eleventy) to regenerate the site upon changes.

---

## Tips for Performance & SEO

- Minimize the use of heavy JavaScript; where needed, defer or lazy-load it.
- Use caching headers (long cache lifetime) for static assets.
- Preload or prefetch critical assets.
- Use lazy loading for images.
- Keep your HTML small and avoid unnecessary markup.
- Update and publish new content regularly — search engines favor fresher content.
- Monitor site performance (e.g. Lighthouse scores) and optimize bottlenecks.

## Sample Article Walkthrough

As an example, here’s how you’d create a new blog post:

1. Add a new Markdown file: src/posts/2025-10-01-intro-to-eleventy.md.
2. Add front matter with title, date, description, tags, layout.
3. Write the article content using headings, images, code blocks, links.
4. Push to your git repository (with build integration).
5. Your hosting platform runs a new build and publishes the updated site.

Because everything is static, the new HTML is served instantly without server processing.

## Final Thoughts

Eleventy strikes a sweet balance between simplicity and power. You get the control and flexibility to structure your site your own way, while benefiting from performance, security, and SEO advantages. As your blog grows, you can layer on enhancements like image processing, search, or custom data sources, but the foundation remains clean and maintainable.

If you follow good content practices, keep your site lean, and leverage Eleventy’s features smartly, you’ll have a fast, SEO-friendly blog that’s a pleasure to build, maintain, and read.
