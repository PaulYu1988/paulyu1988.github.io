## What Is Eleventy?

Eleventy, often abbreviated as 11ty, is an open-source static site generator written in JavaScript. Unlike many modern frameworks, Eleventy doesn't enforce the use of a specific frontend framework, making it a "framework-agnostic" tool. This approach allows developers to create static websites using their preferred technologies without being tied to a particular ecosystem.

## Key Features of Eleventy
<p>1. Multiple Template Language Support</p>

Eleventy stands out by supporting a wide array of templating languages, including:

- Markdown
- Liquid
- Nunjucks
- Handlebars
- JavaScript
- HAML
- HTML
- Pug
- EJS
- Mustache
- JSON

This flexibility allows developers to choose the templating language that best fits their project's needs or their personal preferences.

<p>2. Zero Configuration by Default</p>

Eleventy is designed to work out of the box with minimal setup. Developers can start building their site immediately without the need for complex configurations. This simplicity is particularly beneficial for beginners or those looking to quickly prototype ideas.

<p>3. Fast Build Times</p>

Performance is a core focus of Eleventy. The generator is optimized for speed, ensuring that even large websites with numerous pages are built efficiently. This results in faster development cycles and improved deployment times.

<p>4. Flexible Data Handling</p>

Eleventy allows developers to integrate various data sources into their sites. Whether it's JSON files, APIs, or other data formats, Eleventy can process and inject this data into templates, enabling dynamic content generation within static sites.

<p>5. Incremental Builds</p>

With Eleventy's incremental build feature, only the pages that have changed are rebuilt, rather than the entire site. This approach significantly reduces build times, especially for large projects, and enhances development efficiency.

<p>6. Extensive Plugin Ecosystem</p>

Eleventy boasts a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality. From image optimization to SEO enhancements, these plugins allow developers to add features to their sites without reinventing the wheel.
