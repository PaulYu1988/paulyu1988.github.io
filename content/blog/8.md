## Tips for Choosing & Using Free Icons Effectively

- Match icon style to your brand or theme. Mixing flat and highly detailed icons can look inconsistent.
- Check the license carefully. Even when a site says “free”, some require attribution or have restrictions for commercial use.
- Use SVG where possible. Scalable and flexible—easy to recolor and resize without loss.
- Optimize assets. Compress SVGs, minimize file size for PNGs—this helps with page load speed.
- Maintain consistency. Use icons from same set if possible, or ensure similar stroke widths, sizes, and visual weight.
- Consider accessibility. Use alt text when icons carry meaning; ensure sufficient contrast.
